"Obesity and Malnutrition," integrating data collection, MySQL database management, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Streamlit application for visualization.

Subject: Project Overview â€“ Obesity and Malnutrition Analysis

Dear Reader,

I am pleased to present the "Obesity and Malnutrition" project, an initiative aimed at analyzing global trends in obesity and malnutrition using data sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO). This project encompasses data collection, database management, exploratory data analysis, and the development of an interactive web application for visualization.

Project Objectives:

Data Collection: Utilize WHO's API to retrieve relevant datasets pertaining to obesity and malnutrition statistics worldwide.

Database Management: Establish a MySQL database to store and manage the collected data efficiently.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform comprehensive EDA using Jupyter Notebook to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data.

Interactive Visualization: Develop a Streamlit application to present the findings interactively, allowing users to explore the data and insights dynamically.

Methodology:

Data Retrieval: Initiated by sending HTTP requests to the WHO API to fetch the latest data on obesity and malnutrition indicators.

Data Processing: Processed and cleaned the retrieved data within Jupyter Notebook to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Database Integration: Connected Jupyter Notebook to a MySQL database, created necessary tables, and inserted the processed data for structured storage.

Query Implementation: Formulated 25 specific SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and trends from the database.

Visualization: Employed Streamlit to develop an interactive web application that displays the results of the SQL queries and EDA, providing users with an intuitive interface to explore the data.

Features:

Comprehensive Analysis: The project offers an in-depth analysis of global obesity and malnutrition trends, highlighting key statistics and patterns.

User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit application provides an accessible platform for users to interact with the data and visualizations seamlessly.

Dynamic Queries: Users can explore the outcomes of 25 predefined SQL queries, each designed to answer specific research questions related to obesity and malnutrition.

Conclusion:

This project serves as a valuable tool for health professionals, researchers, and policymakers interested in understanding and addressing the challenges of obesity and malnutrition globally. By integrating data collection, analysis, and visualization, it provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and facilitates informed decision-making.
